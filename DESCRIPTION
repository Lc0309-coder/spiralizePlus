Description: spiralizePlus provides an object-oriented interface extension for the 'spiralize' package. It implements a modular architecture where spiral visualization components (axes, tracks, layers, etc.) are encapsulated as R S4 objects with class-specific methods. Users construct complex spiral plots by combining these components through additive operators (+) in a declarative syntax.
